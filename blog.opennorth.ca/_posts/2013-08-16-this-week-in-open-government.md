- [Quebec Ouvert](http://www.quebecouvert.org) is hosting their first [Quebec City Hackathon on August 29th and 30th](http://quebecouvert.org/article/post/hackathon-pique-nique-numerique). The hackathon will be an outdoor picnic under a tent at the Place de l’Université-du-Québec in the St-Roch district of the city. Quebec Ouvert encourages developers, designers and officials to participate to demonstrate to the government the power of the open government movement. Register for the event on [Eventbrite](http://hackathon-pique-nique-numerique.eventbrite.com/).

- [The Sunlight Foundation](http://www.sunlightfoundation.org) announced an updated version of their [Open Data Policy Guidelines](http://sunlightfoundation.com/opendataguidelines/). Originally authored last summer, these guidelines describe how open data policies can be most effective. Sunlight calls their guidelines a “living document” and are keen to have [participation from the open government community](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2013/08/12/announcing-the-open-data-policy-guidelines-version-2-0/).

- When working to improve access to information, you quickly realize that a lot of data gets lost in PDFs, which can lead to setbacks for all levels of developers. Thankfully, the [School of Data](http://schoolofdata.org/) recently released a [simple guide](http://schoolofdata.org/handbook/recipes/extracting-data-from-pdf-with-tabula/) to extracting data from PDF tables using [Tabula](http://jazzido.github.io/tabula/). Liberate your tables!

- The week, [Fast Company](http://www.fastcompany.com/3015361/can-the-white-house-really-walk-the-line-between-open-data-and-nsa) profiled [Steve Vanroekel](https://cio.gov/author/steven-vanroekel/), the White House’s Chief Technology Officer to discuss the intersection of their open government initiative and the recent NSA leaks. The article provides insight into balance between protecting citizen privacy while remaining innovative in the open government sector.

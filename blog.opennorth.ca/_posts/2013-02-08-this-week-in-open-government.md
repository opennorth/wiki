- This week, Canada Post [released some postal code boundary data](http://www.sunnewsnetwork.ca/sunnews/canada/archives/2013/02/20130207-095833.html) [through Statistics Canada](http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/bsolc/olc-cel/olc-cel?catno=92-179-X&lang=eng): the boundaries for all forward sortation areas (FSAs); the FSA is represented by the first three characters of any postal code. This data release, however, is different from others at the federal level. Canada Post retains their copyright and “official mark” over postal codes, [rather than releasing this information as a fact](http://o.canada.com/2013/02/06/canada-post-copyright-lawsuit-still-going-ahead-bucking-trend-from-rest-of-government/). 

- Samara released their [new report on the House of Commons](http://www.samaracanada.com/what-we-do/current-research/lost-in-translation) which poses a series of questions about the state of Canadian Parliament in the 21st century. The project mentions [OpenParliament.ca](http://www.openparliament.ca) as an example of how the way we interact with the house has changed. You can participate in the conversation by [submitting your suggestion for redesigning parliament](http://www.samaracanada.com/what-we-do/redesigning-parliament). 

- [Ecojustice.ca](http://www.ecojustice.ca) and [UOttawa](http://www.uottawa.ca) have teamed up to create [The Environmental Hansard](http://envirohansard.ca/), an easy-to-use collection of all House of Commons discussions and debates about Canada’s environment. Launched in Summer 2012 and maintained by UOttawa law students, the site is updated weekly and is a great example of reusing [government data](http://www.parl.gc.ca/housechamberbusiness/chambersittings.aspx) to serve a specific group.

<p>We need your financial support to improve Canada’s democracy.</p>
<p>Your contribution supports the development of new projects by Open North and the goals of promoting open data and open government across Canada.</p>
<p>Open North is a non-profit organization. <em>All contributions go directly toward funding our public-mission work.</em> Your support can build new, impactful open-source tools. Even a modest contribution of $20 helps us offset the technical costs of maintaining tools such as <a href="http://resto-net.ca/">Resto-Net.ca</a> that promote public health.</p>
<p>To learn more about Open North and how you can support our work, get it touch at <a href="mailto:info@opennorth.ca">info@opennorth.ca</a>.</p>

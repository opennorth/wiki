- This week, Christy Clark’s Liberals [stunned](http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/05/14/b-c-polls-close-as-ndp-looks-to-end-12-years-of-liberal-rule/) many pundits by returning to office with a majority government in British Columbia’s provincial election. As we mentioned in a previous post, [The Tyee](www.tyee.ca) used our [Represent API](http://represent.opennorth.ca/api) to build a [BC Election Map](http://election.thetyee.ca/) for voters. Post-election, the map now serves as a great resource to review polls and understand how the Liberals pulled out a win!

- The [Apps4Ottawa](http://www.apps4ottawa.ca/) contest, organized by the [City of Ottawa’s Open Data team](http://ottawa.ca/en/open-data-ottawa), has entered its second phase - voting! [Vote now](http://www.apps4ottawa.ca/en/apps) on your favourite open data local app submissions before the winners are announced in June. We particularly like the submission, [Ottawa City Councillors](http://www.apps4ottawa.ca/en/apps/80), which uses the Represent API.

- We’re also getting very excited for the [FCM Annual Conference and Trade Show](http://www.fcm.ca/home/events/2013-annual-conference-and-trade-show.htm) in Vancouver! The conference, which runs May 31st to June 2nd, is the largest annual gathering of Canadian municipal leaders with an expected 2,000+ representatives in attendance. If you’re headed to the conference, be sure to find us at [trade show booth 625](http://www.fcm.ca/Documents/events/AGM2013/2013_AGM_Trade_Show_Floor_Plan_BIL.pdf) where we will be demonstrating [Citizen Budget](http://www.citizenbudget.com) alongside our friends from [Recollect](https://recollect.net/). 

- Calling all opengov developers: Have you ever needed a more flexible [Requestb.in](http://requestb.in/)? We recently released
[Rackbin](https://github.com/opennorth/rackbin) - a small, simple, easy to install and customize postbin built on Rack. Enjoy!

- The Government of Canada is inviting Canadians to comment on their “Action Plan on Open Government” through a [new consultation](http://data.gc.ca/eng/consultations/year1). The consultation is focused on [progress in the past year](http://data.gc.ca/eng/canadas-action-plan-open-government-key-year-1-progress-highlights), which includes the revamped [data.gc.ca](http://data.gc.ca). They have included three guiding questions for comments and participants may submit their responses [online](http://data.gc.ca/eng/consultations/year1) or via [email](mailto:open-ouvert@tbs-sct.gc.ca). Submissions are due September 9th. This is a great opportunity to remind the federal government of the [value of open postal code data!](http://blog.opennorth.ca/2013/03/05/open-postal-code-data-now/)

- The [Open Government Partnership](http://www.opengovernmentpartnership.org) launched a [new competition to highlight the “bright spots”](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/bright-spots-competition) of open government innovation. The OGP is inviting organizations and governments to submit their recent achievements to open government and “improve lives and opportunities” to win an opportunity to present at the [OGP Annual Summit](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/ogp-london-annual-summit) this fall in London. Submissions are due September 9th. 

- The [Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario](http://www.ipc.on.ca) is hosting a discussion on [September 18th](http://www.ipc.on.ca/english/Access-to-Information/Right-to-Know/) on the value of open data as part of their [Access by Design](http://www.ipc.on.ca/english/access-to-information/Introduction-to-AbD/) program. Our Transportation Director, Stéphane Guidoin, will join the panel of experts discussing high-value government data and opportunities for innovation in the sector. Registration for the event is available through the [Toronto Region Board of Trade](http://www.bot.com/source/Meetings/cMeetingFunctionDetail.cfm?Section=Calendar&PRODUCT_MAJOR=DS091813).

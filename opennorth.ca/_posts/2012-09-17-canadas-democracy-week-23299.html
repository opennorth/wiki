<p>This week is <a href="http://www.democracy-democratie.ca/content.asp?document=home&amp;lang=e">Canada’s Democracy Week</a>, an initiative led by <a href="http://www.elections.ca/home.aspx">Elections Canada</a>  to celebrate the positive impact of democracy in the country. The week kicked off alongside the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/events/democracyday/events.shtml">United Nations International Day of Democracy</a> on September 15th. Several events will be held across Canada encouraging citizens to participate in the democratic process.</p>
<p><a href="http://ca.linkedin.com/in/jonathanbrun">Jonathan Brun</a>, one of Open North’s directors, will be speaking on <a href="http://www.democracy-democratie.ca/content.asp?section=med&amp;dir=clndr&amp;document=index&amp;lang=e">Thursday, September 20th at Laurentian University in Sudbury, Ontario</a>, as part of the series “Canada’s Democratic Culture: Ideas Worth Spreading.” Jonathan will argue that, as a way to promote democracy in Canada, all levels of government should make available the information they collect on behalf of citizens, such as data on <a href="http://represent.opennorth.ca/">representatives</a>, <a href="http://www.citizenbudget.com/">budgets</a>, <a href="http://documents.montrealgazette.com/">contracts</a> and votes. By making these datasets available at no cost in open formats, governments allow citizens to create new tools to increase democratic engagement in Canada – tools to build better relationships between citizens and government, to improve understanding and access to information. Access can foster citizen engagement and, in turn, democratic action for a more representative democracy.</p>
<p>Our friends at <a href="http://www.samaracanada.com/">Samara</a> and <a href="http://www.apathyisboring.com/">Apathy is Boring</a> are among the many supporters of the Democracy Week program. They will both be presenting as part of the “Ideas Worth Spreading” series at <a href="http://www.democracy-democratie.ca/content.asp?section=med&amp;dir=clndr/events2012/sep17&amp;document=index&amp;lang=e">the UBC event on Monday, September 17th</a>. The <a href="http://www.democracy-democratie.ca/content.asp?section=med&amp;dir=clndr&amp;document=index&amp;lang=e">full listing of events</a> is available on the Democracy Week website.</p>

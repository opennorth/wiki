- On April 18th, our communications manager [Ellie Marshall](http://www.opennorth.ca/team) will be speaking on a panel at the [AMO’s Urban Symposium](http://www.amo.on.ca/WCM/AMO/AMO_Content/Events/Urban_Symposium.aspx) on civic engagement. The other panelists include civic activist [Dave Meslin](http://meslin.wordpress.com/) and [Peter MacLeod](http://www.masslbp.com/people.php) of MassLBP.  

- We’re happy to announce that we’ve teamed up with [Councillor Shelley Carroll](http://www.shelleycarroll.ca/) of Ward 33 – Don Valley East in the City of Toronto on a [pilot participatory budgeting exercise for residents of that ward](http://ward33.citizenbudget.com) using [Citizen Budget](http://www.citizenbudget.com/). Although this exercise is only an example of what participatory budgeting could do for the City of Toronto, and not binding or representative of actual figures, we’re thrilled to be working with Councillor Carroll to show Ward 33 residents how online consultation can enhance civic engagement. 

- [Alex Howard](https://twitter.com/digiphile) posted a [overview](http://gov20.govfresh.com/beware-openwashing-question-secrecy-acknowledge-ideology/) of several recent ideological debates in the open government movement. Is a government data portal enough? Should all documents from elected officials be subject to FOIA requests? The links in Howard’s article serve as a great resource for anyone interested in the different perspectives and approaches to open government. 

- On that note, [William Wolfe-Wylie](http://o.canada.com/author/williamwolfewylie/) of Canada.com [wrote about Ontario’s first open government failure](http://o.canada.com/2013/03/28/grow-up-ontario/): not disclosing the “Sunshine List” in a machine-readable format. William raises important points about how a government’s open data methodology can greatly impact the usability of its datasets.

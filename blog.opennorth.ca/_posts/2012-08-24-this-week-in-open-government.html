<p>This week we begin a new blog series that will share pieces from around the world that speak to Open North’s mission to make democracy better in Canada. Be sure to follow us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OpenNorth.NordOuvert">Facebook</a> and on Twitter at <a href="http://www.twitter.com/opennorth">@opennorth</a> and check this space every week to learn of recent events in open data, government transparency and civic access.</p>
<p>To start our roundup, here are this week’s must reads:</p>
<ul class="whitespace">
<li>Saskatoon joins dozens of other Canadian cities in the open data movement after <a href="http://www.thestarphoenix.com/news/City+spend+open+data+floodgate/7097675/story.html">council approved $40,000</a> to create a catalogue of datasets.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/">Sunlight Foundation</a>, an American nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that uses the internet to catalyze greater government openness and transparency, launched a new project this week called <a href="http://adhawk.sunlightfoundation.com/">AdHawk</a>. This new app allows viewers to identify political ads as they air and immediately learn who is behind them.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.hacktaville.ca/">HackTaVille will take place on September 8th</a>, co-organized by Open North, McGill University and Ecole Polytechnique. The event builds on the success of the local open data movement, exploring themes of transportation, urban planning, urban agriculture, sustainable development, urban land use, housing, parks, public spaces – and more. All are welcome to join the workshops and hack sessions regardless of experience.</li>
<li>If you happen to live in the Plateau of Montreal, be sure to check out the borough’s use of our open source budget consultation app, <a href="http://www.citizenbudget.com/">Citizen Budget</a>. <a href="http://www.budgetplateau.com/">BudgetPlateau.com</a> gives every Plateau resident the opportunity to submit a budget based on how they want resources to be allocated to city services. Budgets must be submitted by September 1st.</li>
</ul>

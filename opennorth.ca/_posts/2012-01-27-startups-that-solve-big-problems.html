<p>Open North is a non-profit organization, but is it a startup? We sure feel like one! I recently read a brief article entitled <em><a href="http://remarkedly.com/2012/01/27/the-problem-with-startups-is-that-they-cant-solve-the-big-problems/" target="_blank">The problem with startups is that they can’t solve big problems</a></em>, to which some people <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3520654" target="_blank">commented</a> that the problems are structural or legislative issues - not technical challenges. this is true, but it does not mean technology startups don’t have an important role to play.</p>
<p>Open North aims to solve some big problems. Our approach is not so much to solve the problems directly, but rather to empower citizens and groups with tools that allow them to start to chip away at the massive problems society faces. We do not know how to fix healthcare, but we are betting someone out there does.</p>
<p>We all realize there are many, many issues we need to resolve - healthcare, education, sustainability, transportaiton, ... the list is endless. No one startup, person or organization has a the right solution. But, with the right set of tools, people can get to work. That is what Open North hopes to do - empower citizens, organizations and governments to take action on pressing issues and bring Canadian society into the 21st century.</p>

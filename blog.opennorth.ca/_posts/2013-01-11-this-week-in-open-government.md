- Are you looking for your own way to make a difference in your community using open tools? [TakePart](http://www.takepart.com), an American organization that encourages citizens to take action in their lives have developed a [community action tool kit](http://www.takepart.com/Toolkit) to help you get started. The tool kit features resources for learning about community building, stimulating engagement and sharing your success and links to great open data apps to help you. 

- [Alan Dixon](http://consulting.civicrm.ca/) has created a [Drupal CiviCRM](http://drupal.org/project/civinorth) integration module for [Represent](http://represent.opennorth.ca). If your nonprofit’s website uses [CiviCRM](http://civicrm.org/) this module will allow you to easily integrate our database of elected officials in Canada into your forms and petitions, creating easy and efficient communications between your members and their representatives. Thanks Alan! 

- Our Transportation Director, [Stephane Guidoin](https://twitter.com/Hoedic) will be speaking at [TransportationCamp 2013](http://transportationcamp.org/dc-13/) in Washington, D.C. next week. Stephane is leading the development of the [Open 511 API ](http://opennorth.github.com/Open511API/) and will be speaking on the project’s progress. 

- As the excitement around Open 511 builds, Stephane will also be attending the [BC Open Data Summit](http://www.opendatabc.ca/bc-open-data-summit-2013.html) on February 19th. This event, organized by the [Open Data Society of BC](http://www.opendatabc.ca/) will cover best practices for releasing new data and working with open data with a particular focus on the needs of British Columbia.

- [Patiner Montreal](http://www.patinermontreal.ca), our online skating rink tracker built in collaboration with [Montreal Ouvert](http://montrealouvert.net/), has been updated for the 2013 season.

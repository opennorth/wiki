- In May [we announced VeloPlan](http://blog.opennorth.ca/2013/05/10/this-week-in-open-government/), a bicycle route mapping tool by our transportation director, [Stéphane Guidoin](http://www.opennorth.ca/team), that reuses [Cibi.me](http://cibi.me) with calculations from [OpenTripPlanner](https://github.com/openplans/OpenTripPlanner/wiki). To coincide with the launch of the [bike share program in the San Francisco bay area](http://bayareabikeshare.com/), we’ve deploy an [SF version of VeloPlan](http://sf.veloplan.net/). Use VeloPlan to get to your destination in the fastest, flatest or safest way possible (in [Montreal](http://veloplan.net/) too!).

- Stéphane was recently interviewed by Frédéric Harper of [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.com), [Geekfest Montreal](http://geekfestmtl.com/) and [HTML5MTL](http://www.meetup.com/HTML5mtl/) (to name a few) about what Open Data is and how to create a project or a product by using freely available data from governments, cities, and even private enterprises. The interview is available on [Frederic’s blog](http://outofcomfortzone.net/2013/08/26/make-web-war-tv-open-data-stephane-guidoin/)

- A new draft of Popolo, our international standard for legislative data, is [now available](www.popoloproject.com). This update includes support for [JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org/), an increasingly popular [linked data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data) format. Since our last update to Popolo, several organizations have adopted it in their work, including [Openpolis](http://www.openpolis.it/) in Italy. As always, we encourage and welcome feedback from the community on the specification. You can participate by [joining the mailing list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-opengov/) or by discussing [open issues on GitHub](https://github.com/opennorth/popolo-spec/issues).

- Earlier this week we had the pleasure of meeting with the [Hon. Tony Clement](http://tonyclement.ca/), President of the Treasury Board, [about our work](http://www.opennorth.ca/work/) and the future of open data in Canada. This meeting coincided with the [government’s announcement](http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/media/nr-cp/2012/1024-eng.asp) to revamp Canada’s [open data portal](http://data.gc.ca/) and introduce a new data license which follows the [best-in-practice UK model](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/). We are excited by this connection with Mr. Clement and look forward to collaborations between the federal government and civil society organizations like ours. 

- The [UNDP](http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home.html), in conjunction with Mexico’s [Instituto Electoral y de Participacion Ciudadana](http://iepcjalisco.org.mx/), has released a new book entitled [“Technology and Citizen Participation in the Construction of Democracy.”](http://web.iepcjalisco.org.mx/sites/default/files/Libro_TECNOLOGIA_Ingles_version_electronica.pdf). It is available for free as a PDF and covers topics such as e-voting, social media integration, and engagement inclusivity. 

- On November 5th, we will be speaking at the [Gov 2.0 Meetup in Toronto](http://www.meetup.com/gov20toronto/events/88371922/) hosted by [Citizen Bridge](http://citizenbridge.org/). We’re looking forward to discussing our current projects and connect with other civic tech groups! 

- Open North will also be attending the [2nd Annual Summit on Innovation in Public Consultation and Engagement](http://www.publicconsultationcanada.com/) where we will be speaking on November 8th in Toronto about [Implementing Meaningful Citizen Engagement Under Time and Resource Constraints](http://www.publicconsultationcanada.com/conference/detailed-agenda.html).

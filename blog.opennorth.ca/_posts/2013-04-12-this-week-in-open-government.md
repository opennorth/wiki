- If you live in the Montreal area, join us on [April 24th at Station-C for a 5@7](http://mamairie.eventbrite.com) in support of our fundraising campaign for MaMairie.ca. Meet the [Open North team](http://opennorth.ca/team) and talk about strategies for encouraging open and transparent government in Montreal!

- Halifax, Nova Scotia is the most recent large Canadian municipality to [launch an open data portal](http://www.halifaxopendata.ca); the City had announced its open data initiative in September. As a [city spokesperson noted](http://www.ns.dailybusinessbuzz.ca/Provincial%20News/2013-04-11/article-3217887/NS-Municipal-data-free-on-new-HRM-website/1), access to this information could previously cost citizens between $500 and $2,000 plus $55 per hour for the municipality to prepare and distribute.

- [David Eaves](http://www.eaves.ca), a member of our board, recently published an [opinion piece in the Toronto Star](http://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2013/04/05/rules_are_no_substitute_for_cultivating_a_culture_of_open_government.html) that calls attention to the culture and leadership needed in Canada to foster open government. Eaves notes, “we could paradoxically find ourselves living in a world where technology makes it easier to share information ... while our government’s culture makes it harder to talk to the people who can give that information meaning and context.”

- On that note, whether online or offline, it is important to know how to reach your MP and create meaningful dialogue with them. [Samara](http://www.samaracanada.org)’s blog this week [compiled a list of 10 tips](http://www.samaracanada.com/samarablog/samara-main-blog/2013/04/11/political-staffers-weigh-in-ten-tips-for-reaching-your-mp) for engaging with MPs based on information from staffers themselves. They remind us that it’s best to reach out to your own MP, who you can find using our [Represent service](https://represent.opennorth.ca/).

<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>Open North is a Canadian non-profit that creates online tools to educate and empower citizens to participate actively in Canadian democracy. We develop tools for civil society and governments to reduce the barriers to effective participation. We do this with two main strategies:</p>

<h3>Improve access to government information:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>make it easily available</strong>, by pulling it out of dark corners of government websites, taking it out of PDFs and making access to information requests</li>
<li>make it accessible, by <strong>providing context</strong> to numbers, explaining legislative jargon and using language everyone understands</li>
<li><strong>make it relevant</strong>, by letting citizens find information specific to their community, interests and situation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Make participation easy, fun, and meaningful</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>work with governments</strong> to design new participatory processes and to ensure citizen’s voices are heard</li>
<li><strong>increase the number of ways citizens can engage</strong> with elected officials and government information</li>
<li><strong>help citizens connect</strong> with each other and organize around issues they care about</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who do we work with?</h2>
<p>We work with governments, media, and civil society organizations looking to create meaningful exchanges with citizens. Read more about our projects, partners and clients on our <a href:"http://www.opennorth.ca/work">project's page.</a></p>

<h2>Who funds Open North?</h2>
<p>Open North is a federal nonprofit funded through grants, sponsorships, awards, and individual donations. We often engage in contracts with government and civil society organizations to strengthen democratic activity through open initiatives. As a social enterprise, we license our Citizen Budget service to municipalities like Newmarket, Ontario and engage in contracts with media groups such as the Montreal Gazette. We have received funding from the Government of Canada, Google Montreal, Société de développement économique Ville-Marie, and the Institut du Nouveau Monde.

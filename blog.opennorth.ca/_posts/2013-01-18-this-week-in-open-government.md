- [OpenCorporates](http://www.opencorporates.com), the open database of the corporate world, [reached a major milestone this week](http://blog.opencorporates.com/2013/01/17/major-milestone-over-50-million-companies-a-sneak-peak-at-the-future/) – the site now has information on over 50 million companies! Last month, OpenCorporates released an [API](http://api.opencorporates.com/documentation/Home) to improve access to this data. Open North is proud to have contributed over 2 million company records to the database.

- Yelp [announced this week](http://officialblog.yelp.com/2013/01/introducing-lives.html) that they have partnered with local authorities in San Francisco and New York to add health code scores to their listings. Yelp developed a new open data standard, the “Local Inspector Value-entry Specification” (LIVES), under the guidance of the White House as part of this project. We hope to see Canadian municipalities adopting this standard in the coming years!

- Jim Bronskill of the Canadian Press [reports significant delays](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ottawa-running-late-on-access-to-information-responses-watchdog-says/article7343832/) with respect to [Access to Information requests](http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/atip-aiprp/tools/administration-application-eng.asp) at the federal level. We have experienced our share of challenges with access to information at the municipal level, which you can read about in our [“Lessons From Represent”](http://blog.opennorth.ca/lessons-from-represent-if-you-dont-ask-you-do-16430/) blog series.

- We are pleased to announce that Open North has become an official supporter of [OpenParliament.ca](http://www.openparliament.ca). Our friend, [Michael Mulley](http://michaelmulley.com/) is an asset to our work, and we are happy to support him in his initiative to make it easy to track the activities of the House of Commons.

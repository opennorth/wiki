- On May 28th, the Province of Alberta launched their open data portal at [data.alberta.ca](http://data.alberta.ca/). The portal is their first major open government initiative. The portal launched with over 280 data sets and allows for residents to request additional data sets. [Four of Canada’s ten provinces](http://datalibre.ca/links-resources/) now have open data portals or official initiatives, with hopefully the rest to follow soon! 

- [CanLII], a nonprofit that aims to make primary Canadian law freely accessible online, has issued an RFP for a community website](http://beta.canlii.org/en/blog/index.php?/archives/87-Request-for-Proposal-RFP-CanLII-Community-website.html). CanLII is an exciting project that is [changing the flow of legal information](http://www.slaw.ca/2013/04/03/how-canlii-can-respond-as-the-incremental-cost-of-primary-law-in-canada-moves-toward-zero/). Open North’s [Stephane Guidoin](http://www.opennorth.ca/team/) recently consulted on CanLII’s [API and documention](http://developer.canlii.org/docs), which we encourage you to check out.

- For the third year in a row, Open North has delivered our [Citizen Budget](http://citizenbudget.com/) platform to the [Plateau-Mont Royal](http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=7297,84229642&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL) borough of Montreal. If you live in the Plateau, be sure to visit [www.budgetplateau.com](http://www.budgetplateau.com/) to have your say on the 2014 budget and share it with your friends. In just two days, over 120 residents have already submitted their priorities to the borough using this service!

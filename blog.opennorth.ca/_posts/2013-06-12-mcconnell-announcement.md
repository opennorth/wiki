We are pleased to announce that the J.W. McConnell Family Foundation has awarded Open North financial support for its mission and its development as a social enterprise.

This support from the Foundation’s [Social Innovation Fund](http://www.mcconnellfoundation.ca/en/programs/social-innovation-fund) will allow us to more proactively engage with governments and community organizations in identifying data needs that can be addressed through the effective use of technology; to share best practices with the open government and open data communities; and to continue our work of authoring and promoting [open data specifications](http://popoloproject.com/). The support will also allow us to strengthen our earned revenue streams to ensure that we conclude the two-year contract as a sustainable social enterprise.

The Social Innovation Fund was created by the J.W. McConnell Family Foundation to support innovative groups that further the Foundation’s goal of “improving the lives of Canadians and contributing to a more resilient society.” We believe that when citizens participate actively in government decision-making processes, our leaders make better decisions – to make our communities safer, healthier, smarter and otherwise better. We are honored to receive the Foundation’s support for [our projects](http://opennorth.ca/work/) that work toward this goal.

If you work in the government or nonprofit sectors and want to use and share data more effectively, we want to hear from you! Contact us at [info@opennorth.ca](mailto:info@opennorth.ca).

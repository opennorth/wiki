<p>Here is a sample of Open North’s best-known projects. We regularly contribute to other organization’s open-source projects, such as <a href="http://opencorporates.com/">OpenCorporates</a>, an open database of companies worldwide, and <a href="http://www.alaveteli.org/">Alaveteli</a>, free software for making freedom of information requests.</p>

<h2>Citizen Budget</h2>
<p>Open North built <a href="http://budgetplateau.com/">BudgetPlateau.com</a>, an interactive municipal budget simulator, for the Plateau Mont-Royal borough in Montreal. Of the borough's 100 000 residents, 5 668 visited the online budget consultation tool and 523 submitted balanced borough budgets over the summer of 2011. To learn more about the project and what it can do for your city, visit <a href="http://citizenbudget.com/">CitizenBudget.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Gazette Documents</h2>
<p><a href="http://documents.montrealgazette.com/">Gazette Documents</a> is an online database of contracts awarded by the City of Montreal. Built for the Montreal Gazette, the project extracts contracts data from hundreds of PDFs so that journalists and citizens can explore and analyze how public money is spent. To date,  <a href="/press/#database">three articles at two newspapers have been written</a> using this database.</p>

<h2>Resto-Net</h2>
<p>Within the first year after its 2010 launch, Montrealers browsed over 650 000 pages on <a href="http://resto-net.ca/en/">Resto-Net.ca</a> to check if a local restaurant had recently violated a health code.</p>

<h2>Decision Canada</h2>
<p>Open North created the <a href="http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/decision-canada/learn-about-candidates.html#logocol">“Get to Know Your Candidates”</a> interactive feature for the Montreal Gazette, with photos, social media links, and other basic information for all candidates in the 2011 federal election.</p>

<h2>Patiner Montréal</h2>
<p><a href="http://patinermontreal.com/en/">PatinerMontreal.com</a> provides up-to-date information on the condition of outdoor rinks in the City of Montreal. Since its launch in 2010, over 12 000 skaters have used the website to plan their winter fun. The website publishes its data through an API, which developers have used to create <a href="http://patinoires.mudar.ca/">Android</a> and <a href="http://m.patinermontreal.ca/">mobile</a> versions.</p>

<h2>Ma Mairie</h2>
<p><a href="http://mamairie.ca/">MaMairie.ca</a> tracks the activity of Montreal elected officials. The site aggregates what the news is saying about them, what they're saying on Twitter and if they are attending meetings. Citizens can quickly send budget recommendations to their council members to ensure their voice is heard.

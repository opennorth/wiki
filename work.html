<p>Here is a sample of Open North’s best-known projects. We regularly contribute to other organization’s open-source projects, such as <a href="http://opencorporates.com/">OpenCorporates</a> and <a href="http://www.alaveteli.org/">Alaveteli</a>.</p>

<h3>Citizen Budget</h3>
<p>Open North developed <a href="http://budgetplateau.com/">BudgetPlateau.com</a> for the borough of Plateau Mont-Royal to hold an online budget consultation in 2011. The borough of 100,000 residents received over 6,000 visitors to its consultation website and 600 full budget submissions. Visit <a href="http://citizenbudget.com/">CitizenBudget.com</a> to learn more about Open North’s online budget consultations.</p>

<h3>Resto-Net</h3>
<p>Montrealers have already visited <a href="http://resto-net.ca/">Resto-Net.ca</a> more than 500,000 times to check if a restaurant had received a good or bad health inspection.</p>

<h3>Decision Canada</h3>
<p>Open North created an interactive <a href="http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/decision-canada/learn-about-candidates.html#logocol">“Get to Know Your Candidates”</a> feature for the Montreal Gazette, with photos, social media links, and other information for all candidates in the 2011 federal election.</p>

<h3>Patiner Montréal</h3>
<p><a href="http://patinermontreal.com/">PatinerMontreal.com</a> provides up-to-date information on the condition of outdoor rinks across the city of Montreal. Since its launch in 2010, more than 12,000 skaters have used the website to plan their winter fun. The website publishes its raw data through an API, which developers have used to create <a href="http://patinoires.mudar.ca/">Android</a> and <a href="http://m.patinermontreal.ca/">mobile</a> versions.</p>

- David Eaves (an Open North board member) revisited the [Canada Post/Geocoder.ca case](http://eaves.ca/2012/04/25/canada-posts-war-on-the-21st-century-innovation-productivity/), which recently escalated, [on his blog](http://eaves.ca/2013/04/25/canada-post-and-the-war-on-open-data-innovation-common-sense-continued-sadly/). In this post, David explores the financial challenges Canada Post’s policies put on the nonprofit sector, referring to the costs Open North would incur (up to $50,000) if we elected to use their data products for our [Represent](http://represent.opennorth.ca) service. David concludes by noting, again, that we may be the only country with this kind of closed postal service! 

- Open North is pleased to join the jury panel of the [2013 Dazzling Notice Awards](http://www.dazzleawards.ca/). The awards, which were founded last year by [Dave Meslin](http://www.tedxtoronto.com/speakers/dave-meslin/), recognize achievement in government outreach. Last year’s winner, the Village of Pemberton, B.C, [redesigned their public notice template](http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/07/31/pemberton/) making it easier to read and more appealing to citizens. 

- Our executive director, [James McKinney](http://www.opennorth.ca/team), is the [featured speaker](http://go-opendata.ca/schedule/list/#featured-speaker) at next weekend’s [GO Open Data Conference](http://go-opendata.ca/) in Waterloo, Ontario. The one-day conference aims to help build the Ontario open data community by connecting citizens, municipal staff, and developers. 

- Also, we’re thrilled to be joined this summer by [Alexi Garrow](https://github.com/AGarrow), an undergraduate computer science student at [McGill University](http://www.cs.mcgill.ca). Alexi will be helping us as a junior web developer on our MaMairie.ca and MyCityHall.ca projects. We look forward to working with him!

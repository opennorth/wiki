- Next week is [Canada’s Democracy Week](http://www.democracy-democratie.ca/content.asp?section=dmw&dir=about&document=index&lang=e), which includes a series of nationwide [discussions](http://www.democracy-democratie.ca/content.asp?section=events&document=index&lang=e) on topics ranging from civic engagement to international democratic aid. The events across the country are inspired by and coincide with the United Nation’s [International Democracy Day](http://www.un.org/en/events/democracyday/background.shtml) on September 15th. Visit the Democracy Week [events page](http://www.democracy-democratie.ca/content.asp?section=events&document=index&lang=e) for details to find out what events are happening near you.

- In March, the [Sunlight Foundation](http://www.sunlightfoundation.org) started a [procurement initiative](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2013/03/11/announcing-a-new-procurement-initiative/) to research how governments obtain, track and manage their various contracts. As a result of this initiative, they have released the [Procurement Open Data Guidelines](http://sunlightfoundation.com/procurement/opendataguidelines) which they hope will help shape how governments release data on their procurement process. The guidelines, which promote transparency, efficiency and accountability, include suggestions for participants in the process as well. They suggest that contractor performance and project status information should be released alongside financial data in an effort to reduce corruption. 

-The Government of Canada’s [consultation](http://data.gc.ca/eng/consultations/year1) on their open data initiative [has been extended by one week](http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/minister-clement-extends-consultation-with-canadians-on-open-government-1830119.htm), until September 16th. If you haven’t already, please take the time to comment on the open data action plan, its priorities, and any other suggestions you have. You can also view comments previously submitted and promote them within the consultation.

- As a reminder, the [Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario](http://www.ipc.on.ca) is hosting a panel [next week](http://www.ipc.on.ca/english/access-to-information/Introduction-to-AbD), where our transportation director, Stéphane Guidoin, will join experts to discuss high-value government data and opportunities for innovation in the sector. Registration for the event is available through the [Toronto Region Board of Trade](http://www.bot.com/source/Meetings/cMeetingFunctionDetail.cfm?Section=Calendar&PRODUCT_MAJOR=DS091813).

- If you are interested in understanding more about participatory budgeting and how it can work in your community, check out [the Participatory Budgeting toolkit](http://www.participatorybudgeting.org.uk/documents/Participatory%20Budgeting%20Toolkit.pdf). Released by the [PB Unit](http://www.participatorybudgeting.org.uk/) in the UK, these resources can help you design an effective civic engagement experience. 

- The Atlantic Cities [has posted](http://www.theatlanticcities.com/technology/2012/12/best-open-data-releases-2012/4200/) what they think were the best open data releases in the US from 2012. This list could be very inspiring for Canadian municipalities who have yet to open their data!

- Another Canadian politician, [Pat Martin](http://openparliament.ca/politicians/pat-martin/), [has left Twitter](http://www.ottawacitizen.com/news/national/Martin+leaves+Twitter+after+latest+tirade/7726948/story.html) after a heated out-burst. Can we rely on Twitter as a civic engagement tool? MP Charlie Angus, asks this question and discusses his own experience on Twitter in [this Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/charlie-angus/quit-twitter_b_1394617.html) article from earlier this year. 

- To take a break from viewing open data as a tool of open government, what about open data as art? [This blog post](http://blogs.plos.org/attheinterface/2012/12/20/data-as-culture/) from the [PLOS](http://www.plos.org/) research group takes a look at how data can inspire and be subverted by art.

Happy Holidays from Open North!

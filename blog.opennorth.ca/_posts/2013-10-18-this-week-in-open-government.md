- GitHub launched [GitHub and Government](http://government.github.com), a
new website dedicated “to showcasing the amazing efforts of public servants and civic hackers around the globe." The new space for governments to connect and share best practices highlights the Treasury Board’s [Canadian web experience toolkit](http://government.github.com/stories/canadian-web-experience-toolkit/) among a few other examples of open government innovation. GitHub and Government also includes a [few project ideas](http://government.github.com/projects/) for governments aspiring to allow residents to do more with their data.

- [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org) has published a new book on learnings and best practices from the open data movement at the municipal level entitled [Beyond Transparency](http://beyondtransparency.org/). Contributors to the book include Tim O’Reilly of O’Reilly Media, Brett Goldstein, former Chief Data Officer of Chicago, and Michael Flowers, Chief Analytics Officer of New York City. Interestingly, the full text is on GitHub, which means that anyone can submit a pull request with a suggested edit. Code for America asks, “help us improve this resource for the community and write the next edition of Beyond Transparency by [submitting your pull requests](https://github.com/codeforamerica/beyondtransparency).” Beyond Transparency is also [available in its entirety as a PDF](http://beyondtransparency.org/pdf/BeyondTransparency.pdf) and on Amazon.

- If you’re in the D.C. area, the Open Government Partnership’s [Independent Reporting Mechanism](http://opengovhub.org/) is hosting a [brown-bag lunch on Wednesday, October 23rd](https://ogp-irm.eventbrite.com/) at the [OpenGov Hub](http://opengovhub.org/). According the Eventbrite [invitation](https://ogp-irm.eventbrite.com/), the session will address big questions like, “Are all those OGP commitments actually doing anything to advance Open Government Principles?”

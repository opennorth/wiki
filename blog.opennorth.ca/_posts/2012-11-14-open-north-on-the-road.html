<p>Open North was in Toronto last week to present at two exciting events, and we want to share our experiences with you. <a href="http://www.opennorth.ca/team/">Ellie Marshall</a>, our communications coordinator, spoke about our work in the open government sector on Monday at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/gov20toronto/events/88371922/">Gov 2.0 YYZ meetup</a> at City Hall and on Thursday at the <a href="http://publicconsultationcanada.com/">Public Engagement and Consultation Summit</a>. </p>

<p>Richard Pietro and Anita Chauhan of <a href="http://www.citizenbridge.org/">Citizen Bridge</a> organized a Gov 2.0 YYZ meetup on the subject of civic tech and its potential in Canada. We were joined by the team from <a href="http://citizencenter.com/">Citizen Center</a>, Joey Coleman of <a href="http://openhamilton.ca/">Open Hamilton</a>, Christian Contreras of <a href="http://nextparliament.ca/">Next Parliament</a>, Hussain Saleem of the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rocket-man-ttc-streetcar-bus/id421781409?mt=8">Rocket Man</a> iOS app, and <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jkonga">Jury Konga</a>, who’s presented to governments on multiple occassions on the opportunities of open data.</p>

<p>In his presentation, Konga explained that open data projects that try to make decision-making processes more transparent and participatory are particularly helpful in making governments understand the importance of open data. Konga described how our community can affect a change in thinking throughout government with the tools we create.</p>

<p>Among other fantastic projects presented that evening, Saleem’s Rocket Man app demonstrated the impact open data can have on public services like transportation when the right dataset, such as the <a href="http://www.ttc.ca/About_the_TTC/Projects_and_initiatives/Customer_Information_Initiatives/Next_vehicle_information_system/index.jsp">TTC’s Next Vehicle Arrival System</a>, is released to the public.</p>

<p>At the Public Engagament and Consultation Summit, Ellie presented as a part of the panel for <a href="http://publicconsultationcanada.com/conference/detailed-agenda.html">“Implementing Meaningful Citizen Engagement Under Time and Resource Constraints”</a>. Alongside case studies from the Canadian Transportation Agency and the IEFH, we demonstrated the cost and time effectiveness of online consultation through our experience running <a href="http://www.citizenbudget.com/">Citizen Budget</a> in the <a href="http://www.budgetplateau.com/">Plateau Mont-Royal borough of Montreal</a>. Citizen Budget was well received by conference attendees as a concrete example of an innovative tool to help government communications departments create meaningful engagement under tight constraints. Throughout the conference, speakers reiterated the importance of <a href="http://blog.opennorth.ca/2012/11/01/setting-up/">asking good questions</a> and being good listeners.

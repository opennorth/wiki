**About Open North
Open North is part of the growing civic technology sector in North America. Within its first two years, Open North has established itself as a Canadian leader in open government and open data and is looking to increase its impact across Canada.

Its consultation tool, [Citizen Budget](www.citizenbudget.com), is used by municipalities across Canada and the United States. It operates a web service, [Represent](http://represent.opennorth.ca), to lookup the contact information of elected officials at all levels of government in Canada; nonprofits like the [David Suzuki Foundation](www.davidsuzuki.org) use it to allow its supporters to send targeted messages directly to decision makers, while media like [The Tyee](www.thetyee.ca) used it to [inform readers about candidates](http://election.thetyee.com) in the recent BC election. Its work on [open data standards](www.popoloproject.com) have been adopted by leading organizations like [mySociety](www.mysociety.org) and the [Sunlight Foundation](http://sunlightfoundation.com). Its [staff and board of directors](www.opennorth.ca/team) are regularly invited to speak on open government and are influential in the progress of open government in Canada.

Open Northâ€™s activities further its social mission to increase government transparency and to educate and empower citizens to exercise their political influence and participate actively in decision-making processes.

- Ontario launched their [Open Data portal](http://www.ontario.ca/government/open-data-ontario) this week, which means that now three of ten Canadian provinces have dedicated sites for sharing government datasets. Some highlights from the release include, [planned roadwork data](http://www.ontario.ca/driving-and-roads/planned-roadwork), [hazardous waste data](http://www.ontario.ca/environment-and-energy/hazardous-waste-data), and [Ontario’s economic accounts](http://www.ontario.ca/business-and-economy/ontario-economic-accounts).

- Check out these [7 apps developed with data from the World Bank](http://blog.ted.com/2012/10/30/the-world-banks-open-data-7-apps-to-play-with/). Sanjay Pradhan’s TED talk about the apps exemplifies the growing role open data will play in the future of economic development. Perhaps there is an app to benefit Canadians in all this data?

- If you live in Calgary, the city is [conducting a survey](http://www.acceleratoryyc.com/post/35298673908/open-data-survey-for-the-city-of-calgary) to determine which kind of apps would be most beneficial to residents. [Submit your opinion today!](http://fluidsurveys.com/s/opendata/)

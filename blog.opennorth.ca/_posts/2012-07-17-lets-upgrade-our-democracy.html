<p>This past spring, I had the great privilege of presenting at the recent TEDxMontreal event. In my 18 minute presentation, I try to make the point that democracy needs an upgrade. While technology is not a solution in and of itself, it can be used as a tool to improve democratic processes.</p>
<p>The talk spans my grandfather’s escape from Nazi controlled Poland to our budget simulator to bullying in high school. Hopefully you enjoy it, please post comments and rebuttals!</p>

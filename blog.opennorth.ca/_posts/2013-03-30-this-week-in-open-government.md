- James McKinney, our executive director, will be speaking on the opening panel of [Open Data Exchange 2013](http://odx13.com/) at the Jeanne Sauvé House on April 6th. Throughout the day there will be panels in both French and English.

- [Joey Coleman](http://joeycoleman.ca/), of [Open Data Hamilton](http://openhamilton.ca/), [published an overview](http://www.raisethehammer.org/article/1812/open_data_in_hamilton:_are_we_getting_there) of Hamilton’s open data policy process thus far. This interesting article is a great starting place for other Canadian cities who have yet to approach open data and want to understand the challenges of open government. Joey has also included some videos from his advocacy work, which illustrate how we as citizens can get involved with the open government movement!

- The [Knight Foundation announced the 40 semi-finalists](https://www.newschallenge.org/open/open-government/refinement/) of its Open Government News Challenge. Semifinalists now have a week to refine their proposals; winners will be announced in June.

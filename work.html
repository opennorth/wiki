<p>Here is a sample of Open North’s best-known projects. We regularly contribute to other organization’s open-source projects, such as <a href="http://opencorporates.com/">OpenCorporates</a> and <a href="http://www.alaveteli.org/">Alaveteli</a>.</p>

<h2>Citizen Budget</h2>
<p>Open North built <a href="http://budgetplateau.com/">BudgetPlateau.com</a> for the Plateau Mont-Royal borough in Montreal. The online budget consultation tool allowed the borough of 100,000 residents to receive over 6,000 visitors and obtain 583 balanced budget submissions from citizens. To learn more about the project and what it can do for your city, visit <a href="http://citizenbudget.com/">CitizenBudget.com</a>.</p> Click here to see the impact of Citizen Budget.

<h2><a href="http://resto-net.ca/">Resto-Net</a></h2>
<p>Montrealers have already visited <a href="http://resto-net.ca/">Resto-Net.ca</a> over 750 000 pages of restaurant infractions to check if a restaurant has received health infraction.</p>

<h2>Decision Canada</h2>
<p>Open North created an interactive <a href="http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/decision-canada/learn-about-candidates.html#logocol">“Get to Know Your Candidates”</a> feature for the Montreal Gazette, with photos, social media links, and other information for all candidates in the 2011 federal election.</p>

<h2>Patiner Montréal</h2>
<p><a href="http://patinermontreal.com/">PatinerMontreal.com</a> provides up-to-date information on the condition of outdoor rinks across the city of Montreal. Since its launch in 2010, more than 12,000 skaters have used the website to plan their winter fun. The website publishes its raw data through an API, which developers have used to create <a href="http://patinoires.mudar.ca/">Android</a> and <a href="http://m.patinermontreal.ca/">mobile</a> versions.</p>

<h2>Documents</h2>
<p>Open North built <a href="http://documents.montrealgazette.com/" target="_blank">Documents Gazette</a> an interactive tool to explore construction contracts from the City of Montreal. The project was built for the Montreal Gazette and collected data from thousands of poorly formatted PDFs to allow journalists and citizens to see where public money was being spent.</p>

<h2>Ma Mairie</h2>
<p><a href="http://mamairie.ca">Ma Mairia.ca</a> provides up-to-date information on Montreal elected officials. The site tracks what the news is saying about elected officials, what they are saying on twitter and if they are attending meetings. Citizens can quickly send budget recommendations to their council members to ensure their voice is heard.

<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>Open North is a Canadian non-profit that creates online tools to educate and empower citizens to participate actively in Canadian democracy. We develop tools for civil society and governments to reduce the barriers to effective participation. We do this with two main strategies:</p>

<h3>Improve access to government information:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>make it easily available</strong>, by pulling it out of dark corners of government websites, taking it out of PDFs and making access to information requests</li>
<li>make it accessible, by <strong>providing context</strong> to numbers, explaining legislative jargon and using language everyone understands</li>
<li><strong>make it relevant</strong>, by letting citizens find information specific to their community, interests and situation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Make participation easy, fun, and meaningful</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>work with governments</strong> to design new participatory processes and to ensure citizen’s voices are heard</li>
<li><strong>increase the number of ways citizens can engage</strong> with elected officials and government information</li>
<li><strong>help citizens connect</strong> with each other and organize around issues they care about</li>
</ul>

<p></p>
<h2>How do we do this?</h2>
<ul>
<li>We <strong>collect and contextualize</strong> information that citizens need to participate effectively</li>
<li>We <strong>provide free platforms for citizens</strong> to connect with each other and their elected officials</li>
<li>We <strong>create open standards</strong> for publishing and sharing government information</li>
<li>We <strong>help other organizations</strong> understand what open information can do for them</li>
<li>We <strong>are a non-partisan organization</strong> that encourages the reuse of best practices
<li>We <strong>believe in cooperation</strong>: our projects are open source and we collaborate on other projects in our sector and community</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h2>Who do we work with?</h2>

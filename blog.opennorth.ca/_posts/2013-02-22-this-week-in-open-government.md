- Our crowdfunding initiative for the [Toronto version of MyCityHall.ca](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/290328/x/1859729) is underway! This is your opportunity to support open and transparent local government in Toronto; even $1 of support (and especially sharing the project with your friends and network) gets us closer to launching MyCityHall.ca. 

- Tomorrow is [International Open Data Day](http://opendataday.org/)! We are co-hosting the [Montreal event with Quebec Ouvert at the SAT](http://montreal2013.do101.org/index.php/Accueil) and our communications manager, Ellie Marshall, will be at the [Toronto event at the Centre for Social Innovation Annex](http://urbandigital.ca/events/2013/open-data-hackathon). 

- SXSW is only two weeks away! If you’re lucky enough to attend this music, film and interactive festival be sure to find our executive director, [James McKinney](http://www.opennorth.ca/team), and Participatory Politics’ [David Moore](http://www.participatorypolitics.org/about/our-staff/) for a preview of the next version of OpenGovernment.org from March 8th to March 12th.

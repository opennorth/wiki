<p><a href="http://www.citizenbudget.com">Citizen Budget</a> is a powerful online tool to involve residents in decision-making processes and to demonstrate a municipality's commitment to citizen engagement. The interactive budget simulator allows the public to consult and modify municipal service budgets and submit realistic, balanced proposals that express their budget priorities. First launched in the <a href="http://www.budgetplateau.com">Plateau Mont-Royal</a> borough of Montreal, QC in 2011, Citizen Budget has been deployed by municipalities across North America.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://opennorth.github.com/Open511API/">Open 511</a> is an open standard and framework for managing and publishing road events, funded by the Government of Canada.

<a href="http://www.mamairie.ca"><img src="/img/mamairie_logo.jpg" width="300" height="176" alt="" title="MaMairie logo"></p>
<p><a href="http://mycityhall.ca">MyCityHall.ca</a> MaMairie.ca is a resource for tracking the activity of Montreal officials. The platform is currently being developed into an open standard so that civic-minded developers around the world can adapt it to track their local government. It will be relaunched as MyCityHall.ca in summer 2013, with the addition of Toronto and Ottawa. The platform will allow citizens to track the activity of local elected officials, motions, agendas, and give citizens an opportunity to ask questions, and discuss events from city hall.</p>

We are pleased to announce our partnership with the [Participatory Politics Foundation](http://www.participatorypolitics.org/) (PPF) on the next phase of development for [OpenGovernment.org](http://opengovernment.org). Our Executive Director, [James McKinney](http://opennorth.ca/team/) will serve as technical lead on this new endeavour. The partnership will work to bring [open government to the local level](http://blog.opengovernment.org/2012/10/02/opengovernment-is-going-local-with-the-knight-foundation/) in the United States and Canada. The PPF has full details [on their blog](http://blog.opengovernment.org/2012/11/20/meet-james-mckinney-opengovernments-new-technical-lead/), and we will keep you updated as the project progresses. To follow OpenGovernment.org’s development, join the [Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opengovernment) or follow on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/open_gov).

In other open government news:

- [Random Hacks of Kindness’](http://www.rhok.org/) global action days are December 1st and 2nd.

- The [Sunlight Foundation](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2012/11/29/tools-for-transparency-a-crowdmap-for-open-government/), using [Crowdmap](https://crowdmap.com/), the hosted version of Ushahidi, is compiling events on an [OpenGov Resource Map](https://opengov.crowdmap.com/) which could benefit from some Canadian input! If you know of an upcoming event relating to open data, open government or government transparency submit it to this great resource!

- [Canada has dropped](http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/1294170--canada-drops-in-worldwide-justice-index) in the [worldwide justice index](http://worldjusticeproject.org/rule-of-law-index/), making only one top ten list, [open government](http://worldjusticeproject.org/factors/open-government), where we rank 6th in the world. The full report is [available online](http://worldjusticeproject.org/sites/default/files/wjproli2012-web.pdf) and provides interesting insight into how governments around the world approach civic engagement, access to information, legal stability, and transparency.

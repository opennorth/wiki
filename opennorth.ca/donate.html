<h2>We need your financial support to improve Canada’s democracy.</h2>
<p></p>

<p><em><strong>Support the development of new projects by Open North and promote open data and open government across Canada.</p></em></strong>

<h3>What we do</h3>
<p>Open North builds web applications to increase participation in the decision-making processes of government. We develop tools for civil society and governments that reduce the barriers to effective participation. We do this using two strategies: improving access to government information and making participation fun, easy, and meaningful.</p>

<h3>Who funds our work</h3>
<p>Open North is a non-profit organization. We are currently funded on a project-by-project basis through sponsorships, grants, and government contracts. As a social enterprise, we license <a href="http://www.citizenbudget.com">Citizen Budget</a>, our custom budget simulator, to municipalities to cover the cost of implementing each consultation and development of new features. Open North has also received funding from leaders in philanthropy and technology. Along with your generous support, we are able to ensure that our web tools are self-sustaining so that citizens can continue to benefit from them.</p>

<h3>How we will use your donation</h3>
<p>Your donation is an investment in the future of open data and open government. Thanks to your support, we will be able to work on activities such as, but not limited to:  
<ul>
<li>Building new web tools</li>
<li>Maintaining current projects</li>
<li>Handling support issues</li>
<li>Developing new features</li>
<li>Promoting our work and networking</li>
<li>Holding events for our volunteers</li>
</ul> </p>

<p>All contributions go directly toward funding our public-mission work. Even a modest contribution of $20 helps us offset the technical costs of maintaining tools such as Represent, a tool citizens and civil society organizations depend on to connect with elected officials.</p>

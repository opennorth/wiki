- The Treasury Board of Canada announced [a new pilot project](http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/media/nr-cp/2013/0409-eng.asp) to increase the ease of submitting and paying for Access to Information and Privacy requests online. So far, the [new portal](https://atip-aiprp.apps.gc.ca/atip/welcome.do?lang=en) only allows requests to be sent to Citizenship and Immigration, the Treasury Board and Shared Services Canada. More government institutions are expected to join after the one-year pilot is complete. Modernizing this process is very important for the growth of open government in Canada.

- As we start to work with city leaders and community members on [MyCityHall.ca](http://mycityhall.ca) and [MaMairie.ca](http://mamairie.ca), we’re hearing a lot about the value of sharing information on lobbyists. To help understand what municipal lobbyist information can provide, the [Sunlight Foundation](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2013/04/18/a-roadmap-for-releasing-municipal-lobbying-data/) created the [Municipal Lobbyist Data Handbook](http://sunlightfoundation.com/policy/municipal_lobbying_data_guidebook/) to outline best practices for sharing this type of information. 

- [James McKinney](http://www.opennorth.ca/team), our executive director, will represent Open North at Transparency Camp on May 4th and 5th in Washington, D.C.  Details for the Sunlight-hosted “unconference” can be found at [transparencycamp.org](http://transparencycamp.org/).

- Also during the weekend of May 2nd, [Ellie Marshall](http://www.opennorth.ca/team), our communications manager, will be speaking at the [Participatory Budgeting Conference](http://pbconference.wordpress.com/) in Chicago about [tech tools for online budgeting consultations](http://pbconference.wordpress.com/program/).

- Access Info Europe [published recommendations](http://www.access-info.org/documents/Access_Docs/Advancing/Lobbying_Transparency_Via_RTI_Laws_EN.pdf) for government transparency around lobbying. The report calls for proactive disclosures including clear indications of what information is taken into consideration when making a decision. The [announcement](http://www.access-info.org/en/lobbying-transparency/526-lobbying-report) of the recommendations also notes the value of the [Sunlight Foundation’s lobbying recommendations](http://sunlightfoundation.com/policy/lobbying/guidelines/) to be used globally.

- The [Open Government Partnership’s (OGP) Civil Society Hub](http://www.ogphub.org/) issued their [year-end newsletter](http://us5.campaign-archive1.com/?u=6d259217ba4516316461a9498&id=c32e648a99&e=2208d15f4d) this week. The newsletter details the results of the OGP’s recent survey about the organization’s effectiveness. Results include “overall, 63% thinks that OGP adds value to the goals of greater transparency, participation and accountability in their country; and 62% of the community is more positive about OGP's potential to deliver change in their country than they were 12 months ago.” 

- The Guardian published [a look back at the year’s open data and transparency developments](http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/dec/19/open-data-transparency-development). The article reviews transnational level transparency agreements, the top transparency publications, and key dates. Commenting on the popularity of transparency, the article argues that the greatest challenge in 2014 will be to use transparency effectively and adequately address the “underlying issues of power and politics.”

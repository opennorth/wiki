- We are pleased to announce the launch of our 9th Citizen Budget consultation this year in the [City of Cornwall](http://www.cornwall.ca), Ontario. The budget simulator is available to Cornwall residents in [English](http://cornwall.citizenbudget.com) and [French](http://cornwall.budgetcitoyen.com). With submission, participants are automatically entered to win a prize draw. Visit [www.citizenbudget.com](http://www.citizenbudget.com) to learn more about our interactive budget simulator. 

- Do you know a community organizer in your community who deserves recognition? Samara Canada’s [“Everyday Citizen Project”](http://www.samaracanada.com/fun-stuff/everyday-political-citizen-map) is looking to identify at least 308 citizens, one for each federal riding, to celebrate unsung political heroes such as campaigners, activists, community organizers, and members of local riding associations who work through the political system to improve their communities, and whose contributions often go unrecognized. Nominate an inspiring neighbour today or [review recent nominees](http://everydaypoliticalcitizen.tumblr.com/).

- Our transportation director, [Stéphane Guidoin](http://www.opennorth.ca/team), contributed to the [City of Montreal’s Open Data Portal](http://donnees.ville.montreal.qc.ca/) blog, with a post about the technological challenges faced when implementing [CKAN](http://ckan.org/). His post is available [in French only](http://donnees.ville.montreal.qc.ca/ckan-wordpress-mariage-de-raison/). 

- This week, we will attend [#GovMakerDay](http://www.marsdd.com/event/govmakerday-open-gov-conference-workshop/), the Open Government Conference & Workshop in Toronto. The event, organized and hosted by MaRS Discovery District, in partnership with the City of Toronto, the City of Guelph and the Government of Ontario, invites public servants and data stakeholders to discuss the value of open government. [Registration](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/govmaker-day-open-gov-conference-workshop-registration-8460245823) is currently at capacity but we will provide a recap blog after the event for those interested.

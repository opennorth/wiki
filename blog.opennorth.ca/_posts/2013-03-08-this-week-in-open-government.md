You can [rewatch the segment](http://live.huffingtonpost.com/r/segment/reinventing/51350539fe34443230000156) to learn more about our approach to civic technology. 

- The City of Philadelphia [released](http://technicallyphilly.com/2013/02/28/city-of-philadelphia-open-data-guidebook) their [Open Data Guidebook](https://docs.google.com/a/opennorth.ca/document/d/1Kd4AOoRG8q18PVZ0JMusgKWJmgjrWvv3iTdKUjLEdT4/edit), which was developed by their Open Data Working group to help departments understand how and why to release data to the public. This guide is valuable for staff in any municipality interested in best practices for opening City Hall with open data.

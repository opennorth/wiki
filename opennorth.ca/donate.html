<h2>We need your financial support to improve Canada’s democracy.</h2>

<p><strong>Support Open North and promote open data and open government across Canada.</strong></p>

<h3>What we do</h3>
<p>Open North creates <a href="/work/">web applications</a> to increase citizen participation in the decision-making processes of government. We develop tools for civil society and governments that reduce the barriers to effective participation. We do this using <a href="/about/">two strategies</a>: improving access to government information and making participation easy, fun, and meaningful.</p>

<h3>Who funds our work</h3>
<p>Open North is a nonprofit organization. We <a href="/about/#funding">are funded</a> through contracted services, grants, sponsorships, awards, and donations like yours. As a social enterprise, we license <a href="http://www.citizenbudget.com">Citizen Budget</a>, our interactive budget simulator, to municipalities to cover the cost of implementing each consultation and developing new features. Along with your generous support, we are able to ensure that our projects are sustainable so that citizens can continue to benefit from them.</p>

<h3>How we will use your contribution</h3>
<p>Your contribution is an investment in the future of open data and open government in Canada. Thanks to your support, we will be able to work on activities such as:</p>

<ul class="paragraph">
  <li>Building new online tools and improving existing projects</li>
  <li>Engaging with nonprofits over how open government technology can support their mission</li>
  <li>Providing strategic and technical support to open government community groups</li>
  <li>Holding community events and codeathons</li>
  <li>Promoting international adoption of our projects</li>
</ul>

<p>All contributions go directly toward funding our public-mission work. Even a modest contribution of $20 helps us offset the technical costs of maintaining tools such as Represent, a tool citizens and nonprofits depend on to connect with elected officials.</p>

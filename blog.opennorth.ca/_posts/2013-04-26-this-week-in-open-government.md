- We would like to extend a great big thank you to all of our friends and supporters who joined us on Wednesday night for our 5@7 in support of [MaMairie.ca](http://www.mamairie.ca) - we [raised over $400](http://igg.me/at/mamairiemontreal/x/1859729) in one night! We were thrilled to be joined by Councillor Louise Harel, leader of Vision Montréal, Councillor Alex Norris, Councillor Marc-André Gadoury and Councillor Richard Ryan as well. We look forward to seeing everyone again when the platform launches later this year!

- The Pew Research Centre’s Internet project released their report [“Civic Engagement in the Digital Era”](http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2013/Civic-Engagement.aspx) on Thursday. [Stephen Clift](http://stevenclift.com/?page_id=2), an Internet and democracy expert, calls the report a “must read” for the civic engagement sector and [has already commented on figures](http://blog.e-democracy.org/posts/1888) from the report.  

- [Eight additional countries](http://blog.opengovpartnership.org/2013/04/a-step-forward-more-countries-present-action-plans-at-ogp-ministerial-steering-committee/) announced their open government initiatives to the Open Government Partnership’s steering committee this week. Currently, 58 countries have joined the partnership, of which Open North is an [official network supplier](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/suppliers/open-north).

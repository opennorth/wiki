        <h3>Open North Labs</h3>
          <p>We're always looking for new ways to serve our mission to increase access to government information and increase civic engagement. Here we've listed some of our smaller projects, which we call "Open North Labs"</p>

            <p><strong><a href="http://veloplan.net/">VeloPlan</a></strong> is a bike trip planner with a twist: it can also plan a trip with the bike-share system available in Montréal. VéloPlan is also able to change your trip based on your prefence: flatness, speed or security, you decide and VeloPlan gives you the best option.

            Véloplan is a fork of the <a href="http://cibi.me">Cibi.me</a> open source software developed by <a href="http://openplans.org">OpenPlans</a> and relies on the Open Trip Planner instance for Montréal</p>

            <p><strong><a href="http://multimodal.pourmontreal.net/">Open Trip Planner for Montreal</a></strong> is an open source multimodal trip planner. Open North supported and pursued the work of <a href="http://n.saunier.free.fr/saunier/">Nicolas Saunier</a> and <a href="http://multimodal.pourmontreal.net/">Guillaume Barreau</a> to set up a complete instance of Open Trip Planner for the Montreal metropolitan area. Open Trip Planner support trip planning with all the transit agencies of the region, as well as walk, bike, bike-share and combinations of several of these transportation modes, for example walk + bike share + public transportation.</p>

          <p><strong><a href="http://www.yul311.ca">Yul311</a></strong> is an example of a web interface option for 311 service in Montréal. The 311 service is used by many cities as the one-stop shop phone number to declare any non-urgent issue like broken lights, grafittis or potholes.

            In order to make 311 services more efficient and accessible, Open311, an open standard, has been designed in 2009 to submit request via the web. Open311 has been adopted by several large cities like Chicago, San Francisco or Toronto. Yul311 uses open source software developed by the City of Bloomington, Indiana (namely <a href="https://github.com/City-of-Bloomington/uReport">uReport</a> and <a href="https://github.com/City-of-Bloomington/open311-proxy">Open311 Proxy</a> and some custom code) to demonstrate the usefulness of Open311 in Montréal.</p>

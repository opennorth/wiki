We are pleased to announce the launch of [JeVeuxSavoir.org](http://www.jeveuxsavoir.org), an online access to information portal built by Open North in [partnership with the Government of Quebec](http://communiques.gouv.qc.ca/gouvqc/communiques/GPQF/Octobre2013/15/c9967.html). JeVeuxSavoir.org is a website for citizens to formulate requests for information from public bodies. The results of their requests including all documents obtained under the [Access to Information Act](http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=2&file=/A_2_1/A2_1_A.html) will be [accessible to the general public](http://jeveuxsavoir.org/list/all) at jeveuxsavoir.org. JeVeuxSavoir.org will operate as a pilot progam from October 2013 until March 2014 and apply to five government agencies. 

JeVeuxSavoir.org was built using [Alaveteli](http://www.alaveteli.org), free software for making freedom of information requests, which began as mySociety’s [WhatDoTheyKnow.com](http://whatdotheyknow.com) project. Alaveteli has been translated into [16 languages and is currently live in a dozen jurisdictions](http://www.alaveteli.org/about/where-has-alaveteli-been-installed/). 

JeVeuxSavoir.org was funded by the Quebec government’s Ministry for Democratic Institutions and Civic Participation. Development was led by [Stephane Guidoin](http://opennorth.ca/team/) and Jody McIntyre for Open North. [Bernard Drainville](http://www.assnat.qc.ca/en/deputes/drainville-bernard-209/index.html), the Minister of Democratic Institutions and Civic Participation, said of the project:

“By facilitating and enhancing access to information from public bodies, our government allows citizens to exercise their role more as a watchdog in the management of public money. They will be able to take a greater role in the fight against corruption and collusion.”

An [Infothon](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/billets-infothon-jeveuxsavoir-9284906405) is organized for November 30th, to raise interest in this project and the overall access to information process in Québec. During this event, participants will learn how to make an access to information request, what the current limitations of the ATI law in Québec are, and will have the opportunity to write ATI request with our support.

If you have any questions about the JeVeuxSavoir.org project or want to know how a similar website could be set up in your jurisdiction, please contact [info@opennorth.ca](mailto:info@opennorth.ca)

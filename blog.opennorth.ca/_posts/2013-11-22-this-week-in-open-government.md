- It's been a busy week for critiques of open data and open government. At The Programmable City, Professor Rob Kitchin presents [four critiques of open data initiatives](http://www.nuim.ie/progcity/2013/11/four-critiques-of-open-data-initiatives/): from sustainability and empowering the empowered, to barriers to effective use and neoliberalisation of public services. David Eaves [responds](http://eaves.ca/2013/11/18/the-importance-of-open-data-critiques-thoughts-and-context/) to the critiques on his blog, emphasizing some and refocusing others. Panthea Lee from [Reboot](http://thereboot.org/), a social enterprise to improve governance and development, continues her six-week series on equitable and accountable governance for the Aspen Institute, with a [fourth installment](http://aspencsblog.org/2013/11/21/open-government-needs-to-understand-citizens/) about how open government initiatives need to better understand citizens than they do currently. We encourage you to check out the [first](http://aspencsblog.org/2013/11/01/open-government-and-its-constraints/), [second](http://aspencsblog.org/2013/11/08/what-is-open-government-and-is-it-working/) and [third](http://aspencsblog.org/2013/11/14/the-biases-in-open-government-that-blind-us/) installments that discuss open government’s constraints and biases and how to evaluate its progress. Finally, Katherine Barnett and Richard Greene [explain](http://www.governing.com/columns/smart-mgmt/gov-open-government-illusion.html) in [Governing](http://www.governing.com) magazine’s December issue how much more work must be done to fulfill the promise of open government.

- [Google’s Civic Information API](https://developers.google.com/civic-information/docs/us_v1/representatives/representativeInfoQuery#try-it) now includes information on US representatives, acquired from various sources. A key component to stiching that data together is the [Open Civic Data Identifier](https://github.com/opencivicdata/ocd-division-ids#readme) scheme, whose development was led by the [Sunlight Foundation](http://sunlightfoundation.com/), in collaboration with other organizations including Open North. The OCD identifiers are part of Sunlight’s larger [Open Civic Data](http://opencivicdata.org/) project, for which Sunlight [received funding](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2013/01/16/google-org-awards-new-grant-for-sunlight/) from Google.org earlier this year, and whose goal is to provide free and open formats and tools to make effective use of local government data. Read [Sunlight’s coverage](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2013/11/19/whats-under-the-hood-of-googles-new-civic-information-offering/) of Google’s API update for more information.

- Gavin Starks, CEO of the [Open Data Institute](http://theodi.org/), [offers insight](http://theodi.org/blog/node-knowledge-november-2013) into how the year-old ODI operates and how it hopes to pursue its mission of catalyzing the evolution of open data culture through its new global network of ODI Nodes.

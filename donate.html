<p>We need your financial support to improve Canadaâ€™s democracy.</p>
<p>Your donation supports the development of new projects by Open North and the goals of promoting open data and open government across Canada.</p>
<p>Open North is a registered non-profit organization. <em>All donations go directly toward funding our public-mission work.</em> Your support can build new, impactful open-source tools. Even a modest donation of $20 helps us offset the technical costs of maintaining tools such as <a href="http://resto-net.ca/">Resto-Net.ca</a> that promote public health.</p>
<p>Open North is building online tools to make democracy better. Will you help us? To learn more about Open North and how you can support our work, get it touch at <a href="mailto:info@opennorth.ca">info@opennorth.ca</a>.</p>

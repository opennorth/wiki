- Our friends at [mySociety](http://www.mysociety.org/) will use our [Popolo](http://www.popoloproject.com) standard for storing data on people, organizations and positions with their [PopIt](http://popit.mysociety.org/) web service. You can track [their progress on GitHub](https://github.com/mysociety/popit/issues/239) or join the conversation as we work on finalizing this standard through [our issue tracker](https://github.com/opennorth/popolo-standard/issues?state=open).

- [DataBC](http://www.data.gov.bc.ca/), the Government of British Columbia’s open data portal, [posted a review](http://blog.data.gov.bc.ca/2013/02/a-big-week-open-data-day-follows-the-bc-open-data-summit/) of the BC Open Data Day and Open Data Summit, which profiles [Stéphane Guidoin’s](http://opennorth.ca/team/) presentation of Open North’s [Open 511 standard](http://opennorth.github.com/Open511API/).

- The [Ontario Privacy Commissioner](http://www.ipc.on.ca/english/Home-Page/) [announced their desire](http://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2013/02/28/ontario_privacy_commissioner_wants_councillors_included_in_freedom_of_information_laws.html) for city councillors’ activity to be included in freedom of information laws. Government transparency at all levels is the goal of our [MyCityHall.ca](http://www.mycityhall.ca) project, for which we are [currently crowdfunding on Indiegogo](http://igg.me/at/mycityhalltoronto/x/1598726). 

- Open North [recently participated](http://www.samaracanada.com/samarablog/samara-main-blog/2013/02/27/open-north-strong-and-free) in [Samara’s](http://www.samaracanada.com), “Redesigning Parliament” blog series. In our post we suggest a redesign influenced by the F/OSS community and note that a relevant Parliament is one that promotes open access to the government processes.
